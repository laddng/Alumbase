# Alumbase
Alumbase is a PHP framework that allows users to quickly build simple databases of alums. This is useful for those who coordinate alumni networks and want to create a directory for alums to contact each other.

## Setup
To run, simply spin up a LAMP stack or any local server that executes PHP, and navigate to the `apps/index.php` file from there. If you like, there is also seed data to start off your database with some demo data as well as proper tables. Simply execute the .sql scripts in your SQL database.

You will need to connect to your SQL database by providing proper configuration in the `config.ini` file.
